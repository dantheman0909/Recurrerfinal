Follow-up Replit Agent Prompt: Fix Outstanding Issues in Recurrer Build

The build is improved, but the following issues are still unresolved. Please apply the fixes below based on the error type, file, and expected behavior.

Error 1: Time Filters (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly) Not Working on Dashboard
	•	File: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx and CustomerHealthChart.tsx
	•	Problem: Time filter buttons are visible but do not update the chart view.
	•	Fix Instructions:
	1.	Ensure the state hook for selectedTimeframe exists and is updated on click.

const [selectedTimeframe, setSelectedTimeframe] = useState<'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'quarterly'>('monthly');


	2.	Update chart fetch logic to pass selectedTimeframe as a param to backend API.

useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`/api/dashboard/health-chart?period=${selectedTimeframe}`)
}, [selectedTimeframe]);


	3.	Ensure the backend route /api/dashboard/health-chart correctly filters based on timeframe.

Error 2: Customer Health Pie Chart Always Shows 0% / Empty
	•	File: client/src/components/dashboard/CustomerHealthChart.tsx
	•	Issue: Data isn’t populating in the pie chart; it says 0% for all health segments.
	•	Fix Instructions:
	1.	Confirm mock or real data is returned from API with valid health segments:

{
  "healthy": 12,
  "warning": 4,
  "red": 3
}


	2.	Verify chart data prop uses correct structure:

data: {
  labels: ['Healthy', 'Warning', 'Red'],
  datasets: [{
    data: [healthy, warning, red],
    backgroundColor: ['#0D9298', '#FBBF24', '#EF4444']
  }]
}


	3.	Ensure zero-check fallback logic does not suppress rendering entirely when data exists.

	•	File: client/src/pages/Playbooks.tsx, PlaybookWorkflow.tsx
	•	Issue: Buttons for creating or editing playbooks do not trigger modal or navigation.
	•	Fix Instructions:
	1.	Ensure buttons are using navigate("/playbooks/workflow") or equivalent navigation method.
	2.	Ensure PlaybookWorkflow is correctly routed in App.tsx:

<Route path="/playbooks/workflow" element={<PlaybookWorkflow />} />


	3.	For editing:
	•	Add logic to route to /playbooks/workflow/:id
	•	Pre-fill form fields using useParams() and fetch playbook by ID.

Error 4: “Go to CSV Import” Not Working in Admin Panel
	•	File: client/src/pages/Admin.tsx
	•	Issue: Clicking “Go to CSV Import” does nothing.
	•	Fix Instructions:
	1.	Confirm button is using proper routing:

const { navigate } = useLocation();
<Button onClick={() => navigate('/admin/import')}>


	2.	Ensure route /admin/import exists and maps to the correct page.
	3.	If the import screen is embedded, ensure conditional rendering is controlled via state.

	•	File: client/src/pages/Admin.tsx or CSVImport.tsx

const formatted = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', {
  style: 'currency',
  currency: 'INR',
}).format(value);


	2.	Apply this formatter to all currency displays in components:
	•	Dashboard metrics
	•	Customer detail page
	•	Renewal and ARR displays
	•	Monthly revenue per location
