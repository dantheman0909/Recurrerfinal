To integrate Chargebee‚Äôs API using a read-only API key and retrieve data on customers, subscriptions, invoices, and payments, follow this comprehensive guide.

‚∏ª

üîê Step 1: Create a Read-Only API Key
	1.	Log in to your Chargebee admin console. Ôøº
	2.	Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Configure Chargebee ‚Üí API Keys and Webhooks. Ôøº
	3.	Click on the API Keys tab. Ôøº
	4.	Select Add API Key. Ôøº
	5.	Choose Read-Only Key. Ôøº
	6.	Select the desired access level:
	‚Ä¢	All: Grants read-only access to all API resources.
	‚Ä¢	Restricted: Allows you to specify access to certain data sets, such as transactional data or the product catalog.
	7.	Assign a descriptive name to the key (e.g., analytics-readonly-key).
	8.	Click Create Key and securely store the generated key. Ôøº

Note: Read-only keys are suitable for data retrieval operations and cannot modify any data.

üîê Step 2: Authenticate API Requests

Chargebee uses HTTP Basic Authentication. When making API requests: Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Username: Your API key. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Password: Leave blank.

Example using curl: Ôøº

curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/customers \
  -u {api_key}:

Replace {site} with your Chargebee site name and {api_key} with your read-only API key. Ôøº

üìÑ Step 3: Retrieve Data Using API Endpoints

With your read-only API key, you can perform GET requests to access various resources.

1. Customers
	‚Ä¢	List Customers:

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/customers \
    -u {api_key}:

	‚Ä¢	Retrieve a Specific Customer:

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/customers/{customer_id} \
    -u {api_key}:

Note: Replace {customer_id} with the actual customer ID.

2. Subscriptions
	‚Ä¢	List Subscriptions:

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/subscriptions \
    -u {api_key}:

	‚Ä¢	Retrieve a Specific Subscription:

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/subscriptions/{subscription_id} \
    -u {api_key}:

Note: Replace {subscription_id} with the actual subscription ID.

3. Invoices
	‚Ä¢	List Invoices:

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/invoices \
    -u {api_key}:

	‚Ä¢	Retrieve a Specific Invoice:

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/invoices/{invoice_id} \
    -u {api_key}:

Note: Replace {invoice_id} with the actual invoice ID.

‚öôÔ∏è Additional Tips
	‚Ä¢	Pagination: Most list endpoints support pagination. Use limit, offset, or next_offset parameters to navigate through results.

  curl https://{site}.chargebee.com/api/v2/subscriptions?status[is]=active \
    -u {api_key}:

	‚Ä¢	Response Format: All responses are in JSON format. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	SDKs: Chargebee offers SDKs in various languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP) to simplify integration.

üîí Security Best Practices
	‚Ä¢	Keep API Keys Secure: Store keys in secure environments and avoid hardcoding them. Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Rotate Keys Regularly: Periodically regenerate API keys to enhance security.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor Usage: Track API key usage to detect any unauthorized access.
	‚Ä¢	Use Appropriate Access Levels: Only grant the necessary permissions required for your integration.
